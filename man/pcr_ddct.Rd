\title{Calculate the delta_delta_ct model}
\usage{
pcr_ddct(
  df,
  group_var,
  reference_gene,
  reference_group,
  mode = "separate_tube",
  plot = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame of \eqn{C_T} values with genes in the columns and
samples in rows rows}

\item{group_var}{A character vector of a grouping variable. The length of
this variable should equal the number of rows of df}

\item{reference_gene}{A character string of the column name of a control
gene}

\item{reference_group}{A character string of the control group in group_var}

\item{mode}{A character string of; 'separate_tube' (default) or 'same_tube'.
This is to indicate whether the different genes were run in separate or the
same PCR tube}

\item{plot}{A logical (default is FALSE)}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to customize plot}
}
\value{
A data.frame of 8 columns:
\itemize{
  \item group The unique entries in group_var
  \item gene The column names of df. reference_gene is dropped
  \item normalized The \eqn{C_T} value (or the average \eqn{C_T} value) of
  target genes after subtracting that of the reference_gene
  \item calibrated The normalized average \eqn{C_T} value of target genes
  after subtracting that of the reference_group
  \item relative_expression The expression of target genes normalized by
  a reference_gene and calibrated by a reference_group
  \item error The standard deviation of the relative_expression
  \item lower The lower interval of the relative_expression
  \item upper The upper interval of the relative_expression
}
When \code{plot} is TRUE, returns a bar graph of the relative expression of
the genes in the column and the groups in the column group. Error bars are
drawn using the columns lower and upper. When more one gene are plotted the
default in dodge bars. When the argument facet is TRUE a separate panel is
 drawn for each gene.
}
\description{
Uses the \eqn{C_T} values and a reference gene and a group to calculate the
delta delta \eqn{C_T} model to estimate the normalized relative expression
of target genes.
}
\details{
The comparative \eqn{C_T} methods assume that the cDNA templates of
the gene/s of interest as well as the control/reference gene have similar
amplification efficiency. And that this amplification efficiency is near
perfect. Meaning, at a certain threshold during the linear portion of the
PCR reaction, the amount of the gene of the interest and the control double
each cycle. Another assumptions is that, the expression difference between
two genes or two samples can be captured by subtracting one (gene or sample
of interest) from another (reference).  This final assumption requires also
that these references don't change with the treatment or the course in
question.

## locate and read raw ct data
fl <- system.file('extdata', 'ct1.csv', package = 'pcr')
ct1 <- read.csv(fl)

# add grouping variable
group_var <- rep(c('brain', 'kidney'), each = 6)

# calculate all values and errors in one step
pcr_ddct(ct1,
         group_var = group_var,
         reference_gene = 'GAPDH',
         reference_group = 'brain')

# return a plot
pcr_ddct(ct1,
         group_var = group_var,
         reference_gene = 'GAPDH',
         reference_group = 'brain',
         plot = TRUE)
